# IdealSqlTracer
IdealSqlTracer is an alternative to SQL Profiler. It formats and puts all of the SQL in notepad.<br/>

  Steps to use:<br/>
      1. Get Latest source for IdealSqlTracer at https://github.com/harvey007y/IdealSqlTracer <br/>
      2. Build and Run IdealSqlTracer<br/>
      3. A series of dialog boxes will appear that allow you to specify the server, database, username, password, and so on. Here are screenshots of the dialog boxes:<br/>

Once the basic info is entered, a red dialog box is displayed telling you the trace has started. That dialog tells you that you need to perform the action on the website that you want to trace. After the action on the website is done, click the okay button in the red dialog box to end the trace and have the formatted sql appear in notepad.<br/>

     IdealSqlTracer allows you to filter out the noise in SQL Profiler so that you can get just the SQL that is
     generated behind the scenes when you are performing some action on a web page or a desktop application. 
     The application comes with filtering to just get the generated sql for the database that you specify, 
     but you can add a lot more filters in the source code in the app.
